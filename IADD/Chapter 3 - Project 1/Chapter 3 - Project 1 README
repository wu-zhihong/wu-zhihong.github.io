Project 1: Share Your travel photos, time for Some Style 
difficuLty LEvEL: Beginner

Overview

This project updates your existing project from Chapter 2 to add some visual stylis- tic improvements with CSS.

Instructions

1. Use your chapter02-project01.html file from the last chapter as a starting point but save it as chapter03-project01.html.

2. Create an external style sheet called reset.css that removes all the browser formatting from the main HTML 
   elements and reference inside chapter03-project01.html as follows:
   
html, body, header, footer, hgroup, nav, article, section, figure, figcaption, h1, h2, h3, ul, li, body, div, p, img
{
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
font-size: 100%; 
vertical-align: 
baseline; 
border: 0;
}

3. Create another external style sheet named chapter03-project01.css and include it in your HTML file as well.

4. Add styles to chapter03-project01.css so that it looks similar to that shown in Figure 3.31. 
   Do not modify the markup within the <body> element.

Be sure to group your style rules together in appropriate commented sections and to make your sizes scalable 
(i.e., don’t use pixels for font sizes, padding, or margins).

Here’s a hint for the header and footer.

header, footer {
color: white; 
background-color: 
#3D6271; 
margin: 0em 4em 0.5em 4em;
}

Testing

1. Although an exact match is not required, see how closely you can make your page look like the one 
   in Figure 3.31. Be sure to test in multiple browsers and at different browser widths.
